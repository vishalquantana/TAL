# TODO List for Login UI Fixes

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Add eye symbol (password visibility toggle) to volunteerlogin.js
- [x] Reduce gap between field box and alert message in studentlogin.css (added margin-top: 2px to .error-text and reduced form gap to 2px)
- [x] Make eye symbol more professional and neat (replaced text with professional SVG eye icons in all login forms)
- [x] Reduce gap between field box and alert messages in ResetPassword.js (changed inline margins from 5px to 2px)

## Summary
- Eye symbol is now present in all login forms (donorlogin.js, studentlogin.js, adminlogin.js, volunteerlogin.js)
- Gap between input fields and error messages has been reduced to 2px for better UI consistency in both login forms and reset password page
- Password visibility toggle now uses professional SVG eye icons (open eye for show, closed eye for hide) instead of text or emojis, providing a clean and neat appearance
